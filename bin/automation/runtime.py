**"Runtime" Definition**

Runtime is where you execute your code. For example, if this code is running
in a CI build environment, then the runtime is "ci". If this code is running
on your local laptop, then the runtime is "local". If this code is running on
AWS Lambda, then the runtime is "lbd"

This module automatically detect what is the current runtime.

.. note::

    This module is "ZERO-DEPENDENCY".
